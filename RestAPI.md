# Rest API

- Rest : Representational State Transfer, which means the server sends the state of an object and not the object to the client
- That state of an object can be sent either using JSON(preferred) or XML
- Using various methods of HTTP, we can achieve our CRUD operations
  - C -> Create -> Post
  - R -> Read -> Get
  - U -> Update -> Put
  - D -> Delete -> Delete
