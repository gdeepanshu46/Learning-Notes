# JavaScript Notes

## Points to remember-

- Always include your JS at the end of the html file, just before the body closing tag, so that the html css loads first then the JS.
- There are two ways to include JS in html files-
  - Add JS using script tags inside the html file.
  - Recommended way : create a separate JS file.
- Using semicolon is not mandatory but it is good practice to use it.
- Console.log is more preferred than alert() for debugging purposes.
- MDN(Mozilla Developer Network) has the best documentation for JS.
- Always use === as it does data type matching as well.

### Variables 

- let and const are used to declare variables, let is used for reassignable values and const for constant variables.
- They both have block level scope.

### Data types

- String, Numbers, Boolean, null, undefined, also Symbol were added in ES6.
