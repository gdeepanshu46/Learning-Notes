# Maven.

- It is a build tool and Project Management tool.

## Common Problems it solves

-  Adding set of Jars in each project
- Creating the right project structure
- Building and Deploying the project

## pom.xml contains

- Maven co-ordinates
- Metadata
- Build info
- Resources and dependencies

## Phases 

Running any of them automatically invokes all other phase above them, for ex- running test will invoke validate, compile and test.

- validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
- compile - converts .java files to .classes
- test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
- package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- deploy - done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

## Commands in Maven

- **mvn clean** attempts to clean the files and directories generated by Maven during its build.
  - cleans up artifacts created by prior builds
